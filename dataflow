    ╟╴Generate a graph of commands' dependencies on one another. Each unique
    ║ combination of command and arguments appears *only once* in the

    ╟╴Collapse graph to list of strongly connected components. If any cycles
    ║ are found, fail with a message describing them; otherwise, return a list
    ║ of the commands, dependencies before dependents.

  ──╥──
    ╟╴Compile the commands to shell, inserting code to download "commands"
    ║ which are HTTP URLs, and embed the commands in the template script.
